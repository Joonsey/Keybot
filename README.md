# Keybot

A script to keep my character in WoW attacking mobs whie i make food or watch a movie.
Obviously i do not bot as it is against legal TOS, but it's neat if your hands are going numm after 27 hours of farming dragon whelplings.

How to use it: Either import the class "keybot" from "keybot" or call the class in the script with set attributes you want.
